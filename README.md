# EvoHackathon 2020


This year, and with the intention of  fostering collaboration among
bioinspired algorithm practitioners and help them achieve
reproducibility in science, a EvoHackathon will take place the day
before [EvoStar](https://evostar.org). 

# Who

Anyone can participate, whether they're part of the [EvoStar
2020](http://www.evostar.org/2020/) conference or not; the only
requisite is that they want to share their code as free software for improvement with the rest of the participants, or want to help improve other participant's code. Tutors are alwo welcome.

The hackathon is presential, and will be hosted by the [ETSII at the University of Sevilla](https://www.informatica.us.es/), kindly provided by [SUGUS](https://sugus.eii.us.es/).

# When

April 14th, 2020, from 9:30 to 18:00.

# What

The main objective of the hackathon is to engage with code and their
creators, learning best practices in reproducible software and helping
others achieve that reproducibility. This will be arranged in the
following schedule.

* 9:30 - 10:00 → Meet & greet
* 10:00 - 10:30 → Brief presentation: test driven development and science reprodubility.
* 10:30 - 11:00 → Project pitch: those who are bringing their code to the hackathon will make a brief introduction and a wishlist for them.
* 11:00 - 11:45 → Coffee breeak, and organizatio of teams.
